Create a backlog board in GitHub:
- Finish adding descriptions to all the data.

Some notes on the data
- everything is just a string - you should probably change that
- there's lots of redundant columns that just don't need to be there

You need to get the sizes of just each single column of the full data

Each row of the table records a certain observation of an individual (or possible multiple individuals) with a location and time.
The location is encoded in decimal according to a certian schema and includes uncertainty as well.
Ssome of the data has only two decimal places of accuracy and uses rounding to about 5000m uncertaintny using a formula coord = floor(coord * 20)/20
Really the basic table of the data cannot be a naive plotting of the observations.
There's so much silliness 
Also when you plot these points you should use circles of fixed size of 5km radius -> it's more accurate and probably will have better performance

Do an EDA on the Polish data to understand performance issues
Some notes on size:
- biggest columns are ID, occurenceID and catalog number and references which are these long strings of redundant information.
- everything is a string which is what makes the DB so huge

The table has just under 40 million rows.

I think that when I create a clean view of the global data, and summarised it appropriately, it will be something that can be very easy to work with
The size of the columns will come down several times:
- appropriate column types
- remove redundant information (ID) and useless information
- bin and summarise observations together
- simple table with location (double), date, count (int) and species names (small char)
- multiple views into the data - e.g. for the time series, again you don't need to do that calculation in R and you can remove even more columns so that in R your statistics and matrix stuff is much, much faster

DON'T GROUP BY VERNACULAR NAME - IT'S NOT CONSTANT!

For UI, don't forget to use the multimedia, that'll be a big part of it

Performance strategies
* Use a database or other file format like feather
* Trim and clean and compact the data because you really don't need all of it
* Create views in the db to do a lot of the upfront data processing for the same reason as above
* Use the fastverse to write well benchmarked statistical functions for the analysis

save the sql script used to generate the main table.

# Measuring Biodiversity

Two dimensions of data for a given area and/or time:
- abundance of individuals
- richness of species

The relationship between these two numbers in a community defines its biodiversity

But how can we possible talk about biodiversity in the context of an individual species?

For an individual species, biodiversity means
- rarity of the species: it is hard to find the species and you really have to search
- niche/endemicness: the species is highly concentrated in one area, moreso than other species

A given species only gives us an abundance number
The richness number is something we calculate across species (literally the number of species)

So there are four situations of interest:

- Abundant species in a species rich environment
- Non-abundant species in a species rich environment
- Abundant species in a species poor environment
- Non-abundant species in a species poor environment

We may also have some concept of contribution to diversity, where we find the diversity of an area and understand how the presence of a particular species in the area contribute to its diversity and 

This problem is actually so intricate and I can't afford to spend time on it

MODULARIZATION
-- Am I supposed to have the same namespace for different modules.
